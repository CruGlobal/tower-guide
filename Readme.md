# Tower Quick Guide

- If you are working always make sure you are in your working branch, other than master. Your active branch will say (HEAD) next to it.
- If you are accidentally in a branch you do not want to be in, click the 'Save Stash' button and type in a message. You should see the changed files disappear. Then double click on the correct branch. Press the 'Apply Stash' button. The changes should now be in your current branch. 
- NEVER PUSH TO MASTER
- Before you create a branch always make sure you are creating from the master branch. 

1. If you have made changes you will see files listed in the main status screen. Otherwise you will see a message that says no local changes. 
1. To prepare for a push or just to save a group of changes, click the files you wish to add or the 'Stage All' button to add all files. The click the 'Commit' button and add a message. 
1. Update your branch by pulling from master to make sure it can be merged in later. 
- You may have to commit again. If so repeat step 2
1. To push to your remote branch, click the 'Push' button and make sure your branch matches with the option in the dropdown.
- 	If you have never pushed to the remote, right click on your branch name in the left menu and click 'Push To...'
- 	Enter in the remote branch field the name of your local branch(all lowercase, no spaces, use dashes instead)
1. Go to the github page for the repository. You should see a message that says you can submit a pull request. Click the button. 
1. On the new page, you should see a message that says 'Able to Merge' or 'Unable to merge'. If it says 'Able to Merge', go ahead and click the 'Send Pull Request' button. One of the other team members will then merge the request later. 
1. If you see the 'Unable to Merge' message, do not submit the request. It will get denied every time. First you must fix the issues. 

This is a very simple guide, which is by no means comprehensive. This should allow you to use the basics of github with tower.
